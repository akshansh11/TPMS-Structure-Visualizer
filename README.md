The TPMS Structure Visualizer app aims to provide users with an interactive and educational tool to explore the complex geometries of Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS). These surfaces are mathematical constructs that have applications in fields such as material science, architecture, and biology. By offering a user-friendly interface, the app allows users to visualize and manipulate various TPMS structures, including Gyroid, Schwarz D, Schwarz P, and Neovius surfaces. Users can adjust parameters such as resolution and iso value to see how these changes affect the 3D models, enhancing their understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. The app not only serves as a visualization tool but also as an educational platform, making complex geometric and mathematical ideas accessible and engaging.
